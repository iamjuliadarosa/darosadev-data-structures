### Arrays

Array is a linear type data structure that can operate without a specific data type in its indices. This data structure works as a single object that, throught its indices, points to its set components.

### List

Lists are a linear type data structure that depend on a commom data type in its set components. This data structure works as a collection of objects that, through its iteration or indices, points to its set components.
